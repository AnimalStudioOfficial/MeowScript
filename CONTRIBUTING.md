Hey, very cool that you want to contribute something!  
Before you do add stuff you might want to read this article though.

# How to contribute
Before you start to do anything, you might add an issue or start a discussion about what you plan to add and talk about it with the maintainers.  
This way you don't work hard for something that later on doesn't get added.  
Please be also aware that your work might need some changes before it can be pushed. This is not criticism but we (I) want keep the MeowScript standards.
Also Maybe consider making a **module** instead!

## When to contribute and when to make a module
Modules are for external things like making wrapers for libraries/frameworks or writing their own.  
There should be no need for a "better-meowscript" module, but for something like "curl-lib" or "algorihm-collection".

A commit is done when something essential that can't be done with modules gets added. This might include natice commands, new types or concepts.
To get permission to commit something is because of that also not that easy to get, we don't want to merge something broken that we have to fix afterwards.  

Modules are the users resposibility to function. But we have to assure that MeowScript keeps stable and save as well as portable.

# What a contribute should look like
First of all follow the instruction on the template.  
Please tell us exactly what you added, why you added it, how you added it (not that in detail but in general)  
and why it could not be done with a simple module.  

Be prepared to change stuff after a review, and keep in mind that we don't get paid for doing this, so we will take our time.  
It's also possible that we wont add your request at all, because of the reasons given above.

We are flattered that you want to add something and we try to best to listen to your suggestions!  

Now you are ready, if you are confident that a pull request is the perfect match, go for it.  
If you realize a module would be better, follow our template and add your ideas just as easy as watering your flowers!  
We are looking forward to your additions to this community!!  

Cya,
LabRicecat~
